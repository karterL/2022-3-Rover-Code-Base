# Who We Are:
Titan Rover is legacy project club at CSUF. Our purpose is to research, design, and build a mock rover with the intent to compete in the University Rover Challenge (URC). This competition is hosted by The Mars Society once a year in Hanksville, Utah at the Mars Research Station.
Collaborators:
Jason Ursenbach, Chaney Chantipaporn, Sean Del Castillo, Isaiah Odunze, Carter Loya, Joann Sum, Alan Blandon, Pedro Morales, Gabriel Magallanes, and Ryan Luong.


# How to Use the Titan Rover Github:
1. Clone/Pull the Repository into onto your local machine.
 
2. Make sure that you have **ROS-Noetic** on you machine. Link: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu

3. If this is your first time working with the repo, it is recommended that you run the bash script aptListDownloader.sh in the /misc folder. This will download all the necessary ROS dependencies to build your ROS workspace. Make sure you make the script executable, and then run: **./aptListDownloader.sh**

4. If your machine has all the dependencies necessary, you should be able to build the ROS workspace in 2022-3_Rover_Code_Base/catkin_ws using: **catkin_make**
